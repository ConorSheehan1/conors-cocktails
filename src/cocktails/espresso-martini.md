# Espresso Martini

## Ingredients

<cocktail-ingredients/>

## Equipment

- cocktail shaker
- martini glasses

## Recipe

1. Make a cup of coffee and allow to cool.
2. Add the coffee, kahlua, vanilla vodka, and maple syrup to the cocktail shaker.
3. Shake!
4. Serve chilled.

### Notes

- Generally a cup of coffee, 1 shot of vodka, and 2 shots of kahlua servers 2.
- A coffee with lots of crema is best to get a frothy top. Regular instant coffee works ok though. The maple syrup will help with the froth. Adding a few teaspoons of sugar to the coffee while brewing can help too.
- Once the coffee has brewed, add some ice cubes to speed up the cooling.
- You can add ice to the shaker as well, but make sure you strain them out so you get all the foam.
- Espresso martinis are often served with coffee bean garnishes, but I prefer to sieve coco powder on top!
