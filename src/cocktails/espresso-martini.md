# Espresso Martini

## Ingredients
<ingredients/>

## Equipment
* cocktail shaker
* martini glasses

## Recipe
1. Make a cup of coffee and allow to cool.
2. Add the coffee, kahlua, vanilla vodka, and mapel syrup to the cocktail shaker.
3. Shake!

### Notes
* A coffee with lots of crema is best to get a frothy top. Regular instant coffee works ok though. The maple syrup will help with the froth. Adding a few teaspoons of sugar to the coffee while brewing can help too.
* Once the coffee has brewed, add some ice cubes to speed up the cooling. 
* Espresso martinis are often served with coffee bean garnishes, but I much prefer adding some chocolate powder the top!
